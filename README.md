# Team TODO CLI - Collaborative Git & GitHub Workflow Practice

This project is a simple Command-Line Interface (CLI) application for managing a TODO list, designed to simulate a real-world team collaboration workflow using Git and GitHub.

## Key Features

- Add new tasks to the TODO list (`add` command)
- List all existing tasks (`list` command)

## Workflow Highlights

- Branching strategy with feature branches (`feature/add-task`, `feature/list-task`)
- Collaborative Pull Requests (PR) creation and review process
- Handling merge conflicts and conflict resolution
- Code review and merging via GitHub Pull Requests
- Realistic simulation of team roles: Developer A, Developer B, Reviewer

## Project Structure

- `todo.sh` - Bash script implementing the TODO CLI functionality
- `todo.txt` - Plain text file storing the tasks

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/team-todo-cli.git
   cd team-todo-cli
Run the script:

bash
Copy
Edit
./todo.sh add "Your task here"   # Add a task
./todo.sh list                   # List all tasks
